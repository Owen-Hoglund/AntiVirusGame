- [x] Seems that movement is baked into framerate right now, this needs to be changed asap
- [x] Ensure that Guard movement, door movement, bridge movement are all framerate independent
	- [x] guard movement
	- [x] door movement
	- [x] bridge movement
- [x] Guard 
	- [x] lockrotation on xz so that it can only look forward
	- [x] player detection
	- [x] player following
	- [x] return to path algorithm implementation
	- [x] Stun
- [x] **Player Movement**
	- [x] Move away from hovering
	- [x] Add jump capability
	- [x] Add a bit of spring to landing
	- [x] SPRINT
- [x] Deactivate anything that isnt close
- [x] Change DoorPort logic to activate/deactivate as you move through them easy fix #feature 
- [x] Learn about Async await task etc
- [x] Ensure all physics are happening in FixedUpdate #ongoing
- [x] Fix ugly door logic
	- [x] Best Solution is likely to take a lesson from the bridge and have it shrink upward, that way we dont have to have an offset for the door to sink into
