Not a lot to report tonight, but I expect it to be a very busy week. Tonight I am going to add a lot of stuff to the to-do list and tomorrow I will begin to work my way through it. In general, I am going to start laying out the framework for the games progression. Very basic, but a full progression start to finish. By no means will it be unchanged by the end but I need to get something concrete down so that I can work smoothly with targets always in sight rather than just continue to sit down and make little fiddly tweaks.
