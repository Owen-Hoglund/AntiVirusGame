# About
AntiVirus is a game in which you play as a Computer Virus. I have some ambitions for eventually having some more interesting story behind it in which you learn perhaps that you arent malevolent, or perhaps are actually not a virus, and that the constraints that you face are actually the virus etc,. These ambitions must wait, because this is a learning experience and right now I feel that is a bit too much to  bite off all at once. For now, we make a very straightforward game. 
#edit - I dont want this section to be here at all I just wrote it here for a minute while I am brainstorming ideas for storyboard
Major points to hit
- You are a Computer Virus
- You have been quarantined but you havent been completely disarmed
- You have to break quarantine
- You have to find your way to Critical Data and extract it. (Idea for this critical data being in the form of an AI? Moral quandary anyone?)
- You become more effective as you go

Major Mechanics
- You can mind swap with certain bots/guards
- You can shapeshift as certain other things (trojan horse as data etc,. etc,.) #feature 
	- These things have to be scanned #feature first
	- Death #idea (needs to be figured out past entry scene where you just return to cell, perhaps an idea to being able to back yourself up #feature to return to a certain state? make this different from just normal save mechanics somehow)

# Scenes overview
**Scene 1: Prison Break** 
1. Wake up in cell 
2. Mindswap your way out
3. Realize you are in a jail like area with other viruses
4. Retrieve your weapon
5. Mindswap and stealth your way out of the prison 
**Scene 2: Find your purpose**
1. Prison dumps you into a Data Stream #idea (Literal data flying around, maybe in a big tube? its how data moves in the system)
2. Come across some kind of directory #feature (maybe look at map or something?)
3. See Central Data #scene (this should be a scene of its own trying to find the way to critical data banks and also figuring out how to gain access) (Different areas have different levels of security, not every area is hostile, and doing hostile things in non hostile areas should be bad for the character #idea)  ( #scene the prison area is also a research facility and they are sending data back to central data processing)
4. Move towards Central Data disguised as a file (some are receiving more scrutiny than others ie executables vs metadata etc #idea)
5. #scene Data flow has stopped because prison is on alert. You have to copy yourself to convince the guards that the breach has been stopped and that data flow can resume
**Scene 3: Central Data**
1. Arrive at central data and exit datastream before a more rigorous scanning reveals you to be an imposter (Must be able to swap back and forth between being virus form, and a data runner #character)
2. Explore! find a way to make this fun, maybe with little data blurbs, make some funny scenes. Maybe an actual library #idea . Realize that some of the data requires higher clearance to access. 
3. Meet [[The Watcher]] - a non playable, unscannable, neutralish third party who knows you are a virus. There to observe your actions and interfere in some ways where he sees fit. As a token of good faith he gives you a tip - Once per hour the access keys must be confirmed between two classified banks of data to ensure that there hasn't been corruption. If you are able to get your data into the backup, a missing match error will be thrown and they will attempt to find a similar  code in the original data in the secure area. Since your access code isn't there, this wont work, but in exchange for agreeing to insert some data for him, he will ensure that your access code will be in the interior #idea #scene #story . For this to work we need some kind of event system to set things up for us. We obviously don't want to make the player wait an hour #feature 
4. Do this
5. Access interior before the mistake is noticed 
**Scene 4: Classified Library**
